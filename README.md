	[ DISCLAIMER ]
	
		By choosing to use Kelux, you acknowledge that you
		understand the intended use of its modular toolsets,
		which are categorized into two distinct tiers:

			- Lite Tools: Simplified utilities designed for 
			  general-purpose use in both backend systems.
			  Suitable for projects needing lightweight functionality
			  without deep integration or complex behavior.

			- Full Tools: Advanced modules requiring expertise 
			  in backend/frontend architecture. Includes features like:

				- Reactive State and Signal Systems
				- Persistent or Snapshotable Modules
				- Dynamic Lifecycle Handling
				- Framework-agnostic Integration Patterns

		If you are unfamiliar with these advanced concepts or unsure
		about integrating tightly-coupled system tools, you are 
		strongly encouraged to start with the Lite tier.

		This software is provided as-is, with no official support.
		Use at your own risk.
